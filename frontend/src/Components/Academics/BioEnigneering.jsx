      <p>
        Greetings! On behalf of the faculty members and students of the Department of Agricultural Biotechnology at
        Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research (BIHER), I welcome you all to the creative world of
        Biotechnology. I believe the Biotechnology has been widely recognized as an essential source and technique for
        the advancements in all spheres of human endeavour now and in future.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In BIHER all the students get the opportunity to excel in their academic activities. This is the department
        where students are nurtured to publish papers in international and national journals, present papers in
        conferences and symposium apart from helping them to achieve some recognition in extra-curricular and
        co-curricular activities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Among the reasons why our BIHER graduates are such favourites of industries is the consistent hands-on
        experience-based approach of our curriculum, our excellent laboratories, the long-time connections between
        Department and the industry. We hope you will also have the opportunity to visit us to see our
