        Welcome to Sree Balaji Dental College & Hospital, BIHER University. We are a teaching, research, and patient care facility that have reinvented itself in recent years. While our facility is great, it is the people that make our College what it is. Our College has great students, postgraduates, staff, faculty, and alumni.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We are the flagship oral health College in the nation. We have a strong, innovative, nationally recognized BDS & MDS program strongly abiding to regulations and curriculum of Dental Council of India with our own extensions, driven by students through integrated small group learning sessions, early entry to patient care, complete digital workflow in patient care, advanced imaging and digital diagnostic and care planning coupled with valuable experiences in our clinics. In the fourth year there is also the opportunity for students to participate in special tracks devoted to public health, early specialization, comprehensive general practice, and research.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Research success today requires large collaborations crossing what is known as trans disciplinary science. We are reinventing the College‚Äôs research enterprise along those lines, creating bridges and connections and breaking down silos, constructing linkages across campus and with the various communities of the country.
