    <p>
      IELTS is jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge Assessment English.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #b30000; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Why take IELTS?</h3>

    <p>
      English is the third most spoken language in the world, with 379 million speakers worldwide.
